# Umran Haji's Personal Portfolio
This repo holds various personal projects that showcase my analytical work. As a financial industry professional, all of the work I do for my day job is proprietary, and hence this repo only contains a handful of items, such as notable projects I did while in school and the occasional interesting problem I choose to solve in my free time, but I expect the material here to gradually grow over time. Enjoy!

### NOTE: 
GitHub seems to have problems rendering LaTeX in Jupyter notebooks. I **STRONGLY RECOMMEND** you use https://nbviewer.org to view Jupyter notebooks by copying and pasting the link to the notebook.

Also, Github has trouble displaying some PDFs and images therein, so you should download them rather than view them in the browser.
