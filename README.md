# Umran Haji's Personal Portfolio
This repo holds various personal projects that showcase my analytical work. As a financial industry professional, all of the work I do for my day job is proprietary, and hence this repo only contains a handful of items, such as notable projects I did while in school and the occasional interesting problem I choose to solve in my free time, but I expect the material here to gradually grow over time. Enjoy!

### NOTE: 
GitHub seems to have problems rendering LaTeX in Jupyter notebooks. I strongly recommend you use https://nbviewer.org to view Jupyter notebooks by copying and pasting the link to the notebook.

Also, Github has trouble displaying some PDFs, so I you may need to download them.
